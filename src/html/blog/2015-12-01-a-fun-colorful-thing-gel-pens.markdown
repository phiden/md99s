I thought I'd get in on the gift-guide-making fun this year. I'm going to shoot for two weeks' worth of things I love that those in your life might love as well. 

Today's fun thing: gel pens! Like so many, I've rediscovered the nerdy fun of coloring as a (mostly) grown woman, and there's something about the fluidity of gel pens that I especially love.

[These guys from Target are $11.99](http://bit.ly/1O1UMtn) and have 24 different colors. Go nuts!

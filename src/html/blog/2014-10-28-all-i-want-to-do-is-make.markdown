The list of things I need to do for this site, for my [Etsy shop](http://phiden.etsy.com), for my sanity (!) is long, and it's distracting, because it's what I'd rather be doing. But I also have to make a living. So my studio time has been cut drastically, because I got good news in the form of new clients! (ICYMI, I'm a [web developer](http://sophiadengo.com) in my alternate universe.) 

Which is why I find myself in my favorite coffee shop in Hayes Valley, building an app for someone who's not me! It's a fun challenge, but I'm having to work to not think about the things I want to be doing in the studio. Like making more teardrop rings, and playing with the pink gold I received yesterday. Or working on Christmas presents for my favorite they-were-once-Dengo ladies. 

Or mastering my shiny new prong setting technique! [This technique](http://ganoksin.com/blog/pennabilli/), specifically, in which one takes a chunk of tubing and using some strategic cuts, ends up with two prong settings. I've tried it once with some synthetic rubies, and I loved hoq efficient it was. 

It's a self-serving thing -- I have four piercings in each ear and I wear a lot of studs, so being able to make them quickly and beautifully is awesome for my earring wardrobe. ;)

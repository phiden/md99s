So, I just relocated to San Francisco, which means that I lost the badass [studio](http://www.amalgamartsatlanta.com) I was studying in in Atlanta, and also that I have to find a new one.

All of my stuff -- including half of my tools -- is in a container, in a storage facility, somewhere in California. Which means that every day, I go into the closet in my empty apartment and stare forlornly at my studio box, filled with metal and stones and deliciousness, and reaffirm that I need to get into a studio here, because I simply don't have what I need to set up a home workbench (yet). Even my needle files are lost to me. 

I think I've found one, but given that I'm unemployed (hey, want to help me out and [buy some jewelry?](http://phiden.etsy.com)) I'm hesitant to plonk down the dollars needed to get access to the heavy-duty tools I can't fit into a storage container. And every time I hesitate, I feel like an idiot for not doing the thing that makes me happiest. I really should take the photo's advice.

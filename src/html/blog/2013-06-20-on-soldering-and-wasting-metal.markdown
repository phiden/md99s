I spent an hour soldering yesterday. A full hour. And what did I have to show for it? One. Stupid. Tube. In a ring shank. Which, I might add, took all of five minutes. The remaining 55 were spent on an experiment that frustrated me beyond belief and resulted in a bunch of wasted metal, which I threw in the big pile I have to send in for refining. Rawr. On the other hand, at least I learned that the idea I'd had kicking around in my head isn't going to work!

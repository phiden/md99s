I got over my fear of renting studio space, and signed up for a key position at [Scintillant Studio](http://www.scintillantstudio.com) in the Mission. This is my cheapest option, and it means that I have 24/7 access -- as long as there isn't a class or workshop in session. Right now, that's perfect for what I need.

I learned some things, my first week(ish) in this new studio. The biggest thing is that while [Wendy](http://www.amalgamartsatlanta.com)'s teaching style is undirected, that's a totally different thing from not actually having a teacher. I didn't realize what a relief it was to have her _right there_ if I felt I was going off track. Speaking of...

Don't try to cut seats for flush-set stones without some sort of lubricant for the bur. You *will* screw up the seat, and then have to use solder in an unorthodox fashion to refill the band, thus ruining the one stone you'd already set (it predictably cracked under heat). Rawr. Also, solder oxidizes at a different rate than sterling silver, and while I cut most of it back out when I re-cut the stone seat, I'm curious to see how this ring will age.

I get really clumsy when I'm unsettled, and that is the kindest description for how I felt coming into a new studio space. I dropped several 2.5mm garnets (and never found one), upended a bag of earring posts on the floor, and couldn't seem to grip the flex shaft's handpiece to save my life.  

HEAT CONTROL. I stil don't really have it, as evidenced by two melted tubes and some firescale (oxidation resulting from overheating). 

Also, all of my fellow artists (can I call myself an artist yet?) can be seen wearing masks when using the flex-shaft. I was never taught to use one, but I'm thinking I might start. Follow the crowd, and all that. What do these people know that I don't? Is this a California thing?

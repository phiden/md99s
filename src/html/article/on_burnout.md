### Y'all, I am _tired_.

It's been a very big year on so many different levels, and I'm wiped. Just as I started to recover post-move and post-wedding (two lovely things that sucked absolutely every last bit of energy from my cells), I looked up and it was holiday show season! When did _that_ happen?!

I am woefully unprepared -- or am I more ready than I think? At this time last year I was making elaborate plans for blog posts (ha!) and promotions to run (double ha!) and stuff to make, and I felt vaguely panicked by it. (Also, I was planning a wedding, and holy cats, people -- elope if you can. It's a full-time job.)

My unintentional mantra was "you've got to do _all the things_ if you ever want to compete with _x maker/jeweler/person_." I never felt like I was doing enough, and I was having trouble breaking into the Baltimore maker scene. I think I did two shows? One? I don't even remember. Also, why was I so sure it's a competition?

I've done one show already this season -- one of my colleague-friend-people, who is far more plugged into the Baltimore scene than I am, nudged me to apply to three separate events. I applied to two, got into both, and had to withdraw from one because I legit wasn't ready to go. My booth was a mess, I had no idea what was in my inventory...yeah, no. But I did the second market, and it was great! I got excellent feedback and made a few sales, plus I started building my mailing list again.

But maybe the biggest thing that came out of that market was the realization that I have a _lot_ of inventory. Which is a good thing, because I literally couldn't tell you when I was last in the studio. I simply have not had time to get in and make. And if I'm honest, I haven't really wanted to, either. I've wanted to sew, and knit, but there's something exhausting about the idea of spending time at the bench.

I'm burned out. It's that simple. I don't want to do anything in my free time that feels like work, and the bench feels like _work._ And the fact that I haven't been in the studio feels like a failure of preparedness for show season.

This is the permission part: I'm giving myself a break. I have a lot of work complete -- enough to take me through the holidays. (Turns out that when I am working I can be pretty prolific.) So I'm going to show until my inventory is tapped or the season ends, whichever comes first. I have three events lined up in the next two months, which is pretty manageable. I have so much admiration for the makers who hold down full-time jobs, raise families, AND are doing events every weekend. I'd be dead.

I'm hoping that not burning energy on forcing myself to go to the bench will refill the reservoir, so that come next year I can approach _being a jeweler_ with a fresh mindset and energy to spare. I have ideas around that -- you'll see.

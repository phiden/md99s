I had this great thought to join some of my people in writing a thing a day in November. I was all set to tell you about my last craft market and this whole imposter syndrome idea...and then I got locked out of all my websites. All of them. I've pissed off the Dreamhost security system. 

So while I wait for that to get resolved, I'm limited to tapping stuff out with my thumbs. It's not the most conducive way to write, so I'll save my story for tomorrow. Mostly, I'm posting this so that I can say I tried!

I'm just finishing up two weeks straight of work travel, and I'm way behind in all other things, including reading all my favorite websites. So I'm sitting here in the Oakland airport going through my Feedly and I see at least two other lifestyle/crafty-type blogs talking about being in "Christmas mode" already. I might be freaking out a little bit. I definitely have all the plans made, but as you can see...not so much with the holiday mode on this site. 

I'll get there, I promise!

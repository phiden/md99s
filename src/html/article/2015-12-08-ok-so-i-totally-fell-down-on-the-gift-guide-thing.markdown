So, lucky readers (all three of you!) you get a barrage of ideas all at once! These are for the creatives & makers in your life, and they're all things I've used and loved.

First up: to go with the gel pens, you need a good coloring book. I'm partial to anything by Joanna Basford. Get them [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1780671067?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_2&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for ~$10.

Coloring not your thing? Got any knitters in your life? May I recommed the Chiaogoo interchangeable needle sets. I have a Twist Red Lace set, and it's one of my favorite things! [On Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/ChiaoGoo-Interchangeable-Knitting-Needle-Complete/dp/B00BCOA0IA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1448765939&sr=8-1&keywords=chiaogoo+interchangeable) for ~$150.

Also for your knitters, Madeline Tosh's Unicorn Tails. They're 50-yard mini-skeins of Tosh Merino Light, and I love them for doing colorblocked socks and other colorwork. Find them on [yarn.com](http://www.yarn.com/product/webs-knitting-crochet-yarns-madelinetosh-unicorn-tails/) for $5.49.

This one's a little more self-serving, but every knitter loves stitch markers. We literally can't get enough (especially if there's a cat involved who likes to steal them...). I make cute little laser-cut ones that you can find on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/196777977/starry-starry-stitch-markers?ref=shop_home_active_2) for $15. 

Does the knitter in your life need a new pattern? How about the Hue Shift Afghan pattern? I'm dying to make this one -- it's so gorgeous! $4.99 on [KnitPicks](http://www.knitpicks.com/patterns/Hue_Shift_Afghan_Pattern__D41112220.html).

![Othermill-Store1](http://phiden.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Othermill-Store1.jpg)

Ok, this last one's a gift you give someone you _really, really love_ and/or want to spend a small fortune on: [the Othermill](https://othermachine.co/store/othermill/). It's a desktop CNC mill controlled by an easy-peasy user interface. I use it to cut silver and gold, but it does less precious materials like linoleum block and wax as well. $2,199 at Other Machine Co. 

Stay tuned, because next up -- gifts for people who love food & beards!

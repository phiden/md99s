I feel like I'm super disorganized when I go into the studio lately. When I was studying at Amalgam, that was not a bad thing -- we just sort of hopped from project to project as we saw fit, and it was great! 

But on my own, that sort of unguided hopping around is a recipe for danger (witness: the 400+ grams of scrap silver I sent in to Rio today. Though, to be fair, more than half was old jewelry that's accumulated over years.). So I'm trying now to think in terms of collections built around techniques or stones or whatever. I've got sketches like crazy, and I'm noticing a couple of trends:

I love tube settings.
And tiny, tiny stones.
And stacking rings. 
And graceful curves that require control with a saw.

So I'm going to try and use those trends to guide what I make, and see if I don't come up with some sort of cohesive collections in the process.

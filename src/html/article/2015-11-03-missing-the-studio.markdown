The past two months have been absolutely insane. In my other life, I'm a web developer working for [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) as a Fellow, and it's been a whirlwind of conferences, illnesses, travel to my host city, travel home, travel to a wedding...lots of travel.

The end result is that my already-limited studio time has gotten cut down even further. I think since early September, I've only been in the studio...three times? Maybe? The last time I was in was two weeks ago and I felt _rusty._ Worse, I was only going in to finish a bunch of pieces as quickly as humanly possibly in preparation for an independent makers' fair. That's satisfying, but production is distinctly different from creation.

It does not feel good to not be in the studio. My Fellowship ends in two weeks, and while I'm definitely not looking forward to that, I have to say -- I am definitely looking forward to having more time to play in the studio.

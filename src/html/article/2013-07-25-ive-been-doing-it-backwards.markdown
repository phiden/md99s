![Turquoise studs](http://phiden.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_6639-1024x1024.jpg)

Today's discovery falls into an are-you-kidding-me moment. I've been making earrings like the ones in the photo (available on my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/155819350/sleeping-beauty-turquoise-stud-earrings?ref=shop_home_feat), by the way) using the following steps:

1. Use tiny tube cutter to slice off a small section of tube. True both ends.
2. Solder earring post onto backside of tube (or onto a plate, which then gets soldered onto the tube)
3. Stick the whole mess in a pin vise.
4. Cut the seat. Put too much pressure on the solder join. 
5. Inevitably, break off the post and have to re-solder.
6. Set the stone. Return to step 5, possibly.

If I was lucky, I'd only have to resolder once. What's funny is that more than one professional jeweler has watched me do this, and said absolutely nothing about my process. So I figured it was the way to go, until today I started looking for alternate ways to hold the tubing so that I wouldn't shatter the join.

At which point, I learned that I'M DOING IT WRONG.

According to [this article at Ganoksin](http://www.ganoksin.com/borisat/nenam/tube-setting.htm), I should be cutting the seat for the stone FIRST, and _then_ cutting it off and soldering it to the earring posts before setting the stone.

It's brilliant, and I'll be trying that technique this weekend.

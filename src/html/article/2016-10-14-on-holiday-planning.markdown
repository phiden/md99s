I'm not quite sure when it got to be mid-October, but here we are -- with the holiday season fast approaching. This year I decided it's time to get serious about planning for the holidays.

I'm lucky in that previous years, I've had my mother pushing my line to all her friends, or craft shows to participate in. This year, I only have one show lined up, and I want to experiment and see if I can boost my online sales to compensate. 

I'm working through Etsy's [holiday bootcamp](https://www.etsy.com/teams/7716/announcements/discuss/18086933/), as a start. I've been measuring my success on Etsy by whether or not total strangers order from me, as opposed to my mom or friends, and a few have. Yay! That always makes my day. But I'd like to tip that scale even further, to where _most_ of my sales are coming from total strangers.

So that's the first thing.

The other thing I'm working on is really pushing through November and December -- I want to do an Advent calendar of sorts, where a new discount or goodie is released every day. I spent some time yesterday sketching out what that might look like, and I think I may have some success if I promote it on Instagram. I still have to define what "success" looks like there. 

Speaking of Instagram, a good friend of mine, [Amber](http://ambermarlow.com/), promotes her wedding photography business heavily across social media, and she's a big fan of hashtags. I've been experimenting with adding hashtags to my posts (other than #studio tag, which I use to push work photos to Facebook), and I'm seeing a very slight uptick in followers. Not sure that's translating to orders yet, but I'll be adding a couple more hashtags to see if I can change that. 

Finally (and I'm stating this publicly as a method of accountability), I'm going to be relaunching this website. It looks awful on mobile, among other valid critiques, plus it's a couple of years old. Maybe time for a rebrand? 

I'm not even touching on the inventory and production aspects of getting ready for the holidays...that's for another day, but the short version is: MAKE ALL THE THINGS.

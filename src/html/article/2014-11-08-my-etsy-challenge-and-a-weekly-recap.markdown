I have an [Etsy shop](http://phiden.etsy.com) that I've sporadically maintained for a few years, but I mean it when I say sporadically! For a while I just wasn't making anything I would have wanted to sell, but lately it's more that the photography and process of writing the listings was a thing I procrastinated on.

So this November, I decided to challenge myself. We're getting into the holiday shopping season, so it's as good a time as any. For the duration of the month, I'll be posting a new item to Etsy every weekday. Or at least, that's my goal! 

So this week, I've posted five new items to the shop.

[Tiny sterling silver stud earrings](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210281403/sterling-silver-studs-3mm) - $15

[Tiny 14K rose-gold-filled stud earrings](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210086726/rose-gold-filled-sterling-silver-stud) - $20

[14K rose-gold-filled textured stacking rings](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209945905/pink-gold-filled-stacking-rings) - $40 for three

[Sterling silver Orbitals pendant](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209643851/sterling-silver-orbitals-pendant) - $35 ($50 with an 18" silver chain)

[Sterling silver Orbitals pendant (Earth!)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209791016/sterling-silver-orbitals-earth) - $30 ($45 with an 18" silver chain)

Some of these items are ready to ship, and some are made to order, but they're all made with joy! (It sounds so super cheesy, but I really do love making.)

Hello world (that I pretend is reading this...)! 

I recently was granted a pair of privileges: my cousin, M, who just had the most beautiful baby girl, wanted to give her mother a gift to thank her for her help during the last month of her pregnancy. She asked me to make her mother a necklace with the names of her three grandchildren, and I was super thrilled at the chance.

Not long after, M's husband called me. He wanted me to make another necklace, in a particular style, for her. Yes, he could have just ordered it from the [inspiration-giver](http://sweetblossomgifts.com/store/WsDefault.asp?One=1662) (I take no design credit on this one, that's for sure), but part of the gift was that *I* made it.

I think I will offer the style I made for my aunt's necklace for sale -- I had a lot of fun with the stamps and the finishes and the simplicity of it all.

Oh, and baby girl? AG is a little ball of gorgeousness. I'm looking forward to seeing her (and her big brother) grow up.

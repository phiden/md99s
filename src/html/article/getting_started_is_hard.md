My jewelry business is in a sad state. My maker life is in a slightly less sad state. I've been overwhelmed and stuck, and it's felt next to impossible to make any sort of forward progress.

Even with this post! **I have had this post rattling in my brain for — I kid you not — three solid months.** I just had update that timeline, because I actually did start this sometime in June. Every time I sit down to finish it, I start thinking about the eightyseventhousand things I have to do before I can hit publish — or even start writing:

* My website fails spectacularly on mobile. I should fix that.
* My photography is all over the place; I should fix that.
* I need to take pictures for this post; see above.
* I can’t take pictures of the disaster that is my current workspace.
* So I should clean up my workspace, right?
* But that means I need new shelving and a new file cabinet and that means I need a paycheck and if I want to finish unpacking all these plastic totes from moving I really should take a trip to Goodwill and oh right the sheets piled up on the top of that one tote need to be folded…and on and on and ON.

I’m shaving the damn yak on writing a blog post about GETTING STARTED, for chrissakes. This is the path I go down lately every time I try to start literally anything not immediately related to my day job, and most of the time I get stuck in the anxiety.

But here’s the thing sometimes: you Just. Have. To. Start. All of the ideas that are taking up pages and pages of my everyday-carry notebook aren't going to execute themselves.

So I started this post in Notes, so that I wouldn’t have to think about the Wordpress updates that my site needs, which makes me think about abandoning Wordpress altogether for something like Metalsmith or Jekyll and oh look, I’ve gone down another rabbit hole.

Ahem.

Here’s what my workspace looks like now [horrifying photo]. Just kidding. I'm not subjecting you to that. Suffice to say it's an inefficient disaster.

My partner Gavin and I just bought a house, got married, and moved — all inside a month. And then we got a kitten. Our new house is the cutest thing ever (second to the kitten), but it is not yet well-suited to a supply hoarder and two people who work entirely from home. Organization is desperately needed. We’re working on it.

My workspace — my desk — is covered in wedding-prep leftovers that I’m not sure what to do with, and the muslin for a pair of shorts that I bought materials for months ago that I still haven't actually _sewn together yet._ I did, finally, unbox the beautiful new sewing machines I bought at [Craftcation](URL) in April, and I've made a handful of quick things just for the joy of using new tools. That meant taking over my living room and challenging my new husband's patience as I blocked his access to his record player with a metric ton of fabric (he is a _very patient person_).

And I did (in the last hour, anyway, because I'm sitting on a plane on a the way to a developer conference) start building this site in Metalsmith, so if it looks super janky we'll go ahead and blame it on that!

It's just been a bananas few months. I have a list of posts I want to write -- about taking care of yourself, and getting burned out, and is it really okay to take a break? (The answer to that is a resounding YES). I'll keep telling myself that I'll write them, and I'll keep giving myself permission to not, if I have other things that require my energy first. But for now, this is a starting point.

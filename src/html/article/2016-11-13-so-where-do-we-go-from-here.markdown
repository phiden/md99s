Look, I'm going to leave the political commentary to other, smarter, more eloquent writers. I'm also going to leave it up to you to go find the commentary that best suits your needs at this particular moment in time. I will say, though, that I am profoundly disappointed, more than a little scared, and somewhat paralyzed in the wake of Tuesday's election. 

It seems frivolous and dumb and futile to keep thrashing against this tiny little hustle of mine, but then again...this is the ish that makes me feel good. I literally bring a little beauty in the world. And if I can make a little extra scratch, then that's a little more that I can use to support those who will need it in the next howeverlong. 

So today I post this, I make some chili, and I take a nap...and then I get off my ass and get to work, both on this and on the rest of life. So look forward to <a href='http://phiden.etsy.com' target="_blank'>Etsy updates ahead of the holidays, more on self-care and the studio, and mayyyyyybe even a gift guide or two.

In the meantime, be safe, be kind (especially to yourself -- self-care is a real need, y'all), be strong.

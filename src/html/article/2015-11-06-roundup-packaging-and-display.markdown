You may have noticed a theme this week -- I've been talking a lot about doing indie markets and craft fairs. I figured it's only fair to include a roundup of my favorite resources for display, packaging and inspiration.

**DISPLAY**

There's nothing like Pinterest for inspiration and resources. I have a [whole board full of pins](https://www.pinterest.com/phiden/package-display/), but here are some favorites:



	
  * [My favorite ring displays](http://nilecorp.com/index.php/wooden-ring-display-13-w-x-2-1-2-d-x-3-h.html) -- these guys have been invaluable. I have a 5-finger one and several singles.

	
  * [A self-standing earring board](http://theother128hours.blogspot.com/2012/08/ally-get-me-to-festival-week-1-jewelry.html) -- I made a variation on this that's easy to break down and store flat. The link also includes a tutorial for necklace boards, which might be my next display project.

	
  * [Necklace boards](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/136937644896724304/) -- the owner of this shop has it on vacation, but the concept looks DIY-able.


I'd also recommend some signage, since it's generally a good thing for people to know who you are. My friend Josh at [Duo + Graphics](http://duo-graphics.com) helped me design and print the perfect one for me, but I've seen plenty of people DIY these as well.

**PACKAGING**

This is where I battle between the idea of "branding" and the knowledge that most of my customers are one-time buyers -- they're not noticing if my "branding" is consistent as far as packaging is concerned. It gives me the freedom to experiment with printed materials and packing materials.



	
  * [Muslin drawstring bags](http://www.amazon.com/Cotton-Muslin-Double-Drawstring-Count/dp/B00X7QB742/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1446833276&sr=8-9&keywords=muslin+drawstring+bags) -- I buy mine from Amazon because it's easy, but you can find them all over the Internet.

	
  * Stickers, postcards & business cards -- I'm a big fan of [Moo](http://moo.com), and they just keep on expanding their product offerings. [Stickermule ](https://www.stickermule.com/)also does customs stickers.

	
  * For mailing pieces, I can't say enough good things about a sturdy padded envelope. I use[ 6"x10" bubble mailers](http://www.amazon.com/Self-Seal-Cushion-Envelope-Mailers-AirPrime/dp/B00NLPD4WM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1446833437&sr=8-3&keywords=8x10+padded+envelope), which I buy in packs of 10 from Amazon. Much cheaper than buying singles from the post office, and more convenient as well.


**INSPIRATION**

I really had no idea where to start when I started doing indie markets. I used to do the windows and cases at the bead shop I worked in through high school and college, but it became clear pretty quickly that the same techniques that work when things _aren't _being handled every few minutes don't work in a booth setting. Pinterest to the rescue again!



	
  * [DandyBeads' necklace display](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruby_shoes_sam/8691808905/) is one I keep coming back to, thinking I'll emulate the layout.

	
  * I love this [card holder](https://www.etsy.com/listing/180970585/jewelry-display-board-or-business-card?ref=market) from [Bella Cornicello](https://www.etsy.com/shop/bellacornicello?ref=l2-shopheader-name) on Etsy -- it's more sophisticated than my current "dump them on the table" display method.

	
  * [This table setup](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/136937644896423230/) is gorgeous -- I love the different visual levels and how organized everything looks, without feeling sterile or boring.



You'll notice I didn't post any pictures of my own setup. That's because I don't like it, and also because I don't have very good pictures!

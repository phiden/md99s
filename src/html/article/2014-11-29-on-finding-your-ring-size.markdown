I firmly believe that your ring size is one of those numbers that everyone should know, along with your blood type and your correct bra size (if you're a bra-wearer, anyway). But I have a theory that because it's so easy to try on rings (as opposed to trying on bras, which is a pain in the ass) that nobody actually knows their size. I've sent many people to get sized in the past year, so behold, my primer on getting your ring size! 

There are a couple of ways to do this. One way or the other, though, be sure to note if your size is in US or UK units -- there is a difference! The first, and simultaneously the easiest and least convenient (I think, anyway) is to go to a jewelry store and ask them to either 1) size your fingers or 2) size a ring that fits well. Any reputable jewelry store will do this for free, even if you don't purchase something from them.

But if you feel weird walking into a store and asking for a free service without any intention of buying from them (a feeling I totally understand, by the way), there are alternatives!

My favorite method is this neat site I found way back in the day before I knew my own ring size. It's called [Find My Ringsize](http://findmyringsize.com), and they'll walk you through the process of sizing either with a ring you already have, or the piece-of-paper-and-a-ruler method.

The piece-of-paper-and-a-ruler method, minus the web, is another alternative. Basically, you make a paper or string ring for yourself and measure the length. You're getting the circumference of your finger, which is then translated into your ring size by your trusty ring-making jeweler! 

The last method (and nerdiest) is my last resort, because it involves math. *shudder* Plus, it can be inaccurate (but then again, so can measuring against yarn or paper). It's this: get the diameter of a ring that fits, and use that to calculate the circumference of your finger.

These methods are neatly wrapped up in [this PDF from Zales](http://images.zales.com/images/popups/zales_ringsizer.pdf), if you want a paper reference. Thanks, Zales!

And y'know, once you know your ring size, if you want to head over to [my shop](http://phiden.etsy.com)...well, I won't argue!

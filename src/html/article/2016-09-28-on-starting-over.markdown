So, almost nine months ago, we uprooted our whole lives and moved to Baltimore from San Francisco so that I could start a new job. There were a lot of things I was anticipating in this move: the expense, the stress, having to furnish someplace new, find new friends, new workspace...it was a long list.

Even so, there's one thing I wasn't counting on (though I should have realized): moving across the country meant that the (tiny but mighty) audience I'd cultivated in San Francisco and surrounds would evaporate. Not to mention my momentum! I went from having a make-apply-show cycle that was pretty steady to struggling just to find time to get in the studio.

So now I start over. I found bench space at the [Baltimore Jewelry Center](http://baltimorejewelrycenter.org/), an amazing facility with lovely tools and lovely people. I bought myself an [Othermill](https://othermachine.co/), since the one I was using lives in San Francisco. 

I've started prototyping new pieces and thinking about how to move this forward with some sense of purpose, rather than in the sporadic bursts I've been having since moving. And I'm looking forward to rebuilding that audience! I'm hoping to show at least once this holiday season in Baltimore, and am actively working towards waking up my virtual presence. Let's see how this goes, shall we?

When I started renting space at Scintillant Studio, I found myself in a novel situation: for the first time since I'd started silversmithing, I couldn't rely entirely on using someone else's tools. Scintillant provides the heavier lifts -- the tanks and torches, flex shafts, polishing tools, and a whole range of hammers and mallets. Hand tools, however, are another story: I had to make a quick investment in buffing wheels & polishes, a jewelry saw, sandpaper sticks, solders and flux, specialty pliers...relatively minor things but all things I'd relied on previous studios to provide. 

In the time that's elapsed since, I've continued adding to my toolkit -- such that the next time I move studios, I should be in pretty good shape from a tools perspective. For the most part, everything lives in plastic boxes in my locker at the studio, but there are some things I carry back and forth -- stones and some of my metal, some of my pliers and polishing cloths live in their own portable kit. 

Here's a breakdown of what lives in my kits.
